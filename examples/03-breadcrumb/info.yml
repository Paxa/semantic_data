title: Breadcrumb example
itemtypes:
  - http://schema.org/WebPage
  - http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb
  
description: |
  A breadcrumb trail is a set of links (breadcrumbs) that can help a user understand and navigate your site's hierarchy.
  Pages can have more than one breadcrumb trail. For example:
      
      Books &gt; Authors &gt; Stephen King
      Books &gt; Fiction &gt; Horror
  
  This is modeled on the data-vocabulary.org microdata syntax example on Google:
  [http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=185417](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=185417)
  
  There are 2 vocabularies what can describe breadcrumbs: http://schema.org/WebPage and 
  http://data-vocabulary.org/Breadcrumb
  
  If you read the specification (http://schema.org/WebPage) the Expected Type for
  "breadcrumb" is text, so it doesn't really matter if it's a link or
  not. Semantically, a breadcrumb is really only a category marker and it
  shouldn't matter if it's a link or not. It's need to understand where you 
  are now. In modern uses, it is hyperlinked for usability, but technically, it 
  doesn't need to be linked for a human or bot to parse out the categorization structure.
