Practical Usage of microdata


New technologies allow you to do things in right way. RDF, RDFa, microdata and microformats tell us how to make information in internet readable for computers, but WHO actually read it? 

* [Google](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets) uses it to analyze which kind of data on page and to make a special view on results page. You can see examples an [Rich Snippets](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets) page.

* Easier access from JavaScript code and then you parse page on server. There a lot of libraries working with this modern feature. Like [microdatajs](https://gitorious.org/microdatajs/), [Microdata-JS](http://github.com/carlmw/Microdata-JS), [mida rubygem and CLI](https://github.com/lawrencewoodman/mida/)

* You come close to future.

As for me - I thinking a lot about clever data collecting, making everything programmable and what will be in internet tomorrow or next year. And I imagine what if I could make some work automatically, such a placing information about all offline shops on map. Or fill items in online catalog by typing only names. Or finding pictures for some stuff...

Computers don't feel bored or lazy, so they can work for years without food, sleep and money :). Semantic structures helps to put all information in it's out place and computers can work with it. And microdata is part of standard, and it's easy to use it.

I wonder if every website will have semantic linking and internet will become a biggest computer library with all kind of information. Try to imagine that you will able to do then!
